V4VSockets is built as a full-stack protocol framework that supports
peer-to-peer communication between co-located VMs. %We bypass the intermediate
%layer and use the hypervisor as the control \emph{and} the data plane. 

$\Rightarrow$ \emph{Application layer}: the socket interface.

$\Rightarrow$ \emph{Transport layer}: VM kernel driver.

$\Rightarrow$ \emph{Network/Link layer}: the hypervisor, providing encapsulation of upper-layer messages to packets and packet delivery.

$\Rightarrow$ V4VSockets\footnote{https://github.com/HPSI/v4v}, an efficient, socket-compliant, high--performance intra-node communication framework.

$\Rightarrow$ optimized data path. Data are copied from~/~to the VM kernel memory
without the need to share pages between VMs.

$\Rightarrow$ no intermediary VM (driver domain), so no scheduling implications are involved. 

$\Rightarrow$ V4VSockets preliminary evaluation, using generic micro-benchmarks and compare it to conventional communication paths. V4VSockets outperforms the
generic method of intra-node communication and scales efficiently with a large
number of VMs both in terms of throughput as well as latency.

$\Rightarrow$ ra eal-life use case: we deploy an HPC application
stencil over rCUDA, a remote GPU execution stack over V4VSockets.

This experiment includes the following procedure: two copies of the input
matrices from node's main memory to GPU device memory, the product execution on
the GPU and finally one copy of the output matrix back to main memory. % The
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/total_cublas_time.eps}
%normalized total time of execution of the matrix-matrix product benchmark is
%depicted in the Figure on the left.

To elaborate more on the impact of V4VSockets to the improvement in the
execution time, we plot the throughput achieved when copying one of the input
matrices from the machine's main memory to the GPU device memory (essentially
this is a \texttt{cudamemcpy()} call).
\end{multicols}

%We observe that the peak throughput is 3.79 GB/s in our baseline experiment,
%while the respective throughput in the remote V4VSockets case is 2.46 GB/s.
%However, for a matrix size of 34 MB (2112 x 4224 float type elements)
%V4VSockets outperforms the generic case by a factor of 7 (0.35 GB/s).
