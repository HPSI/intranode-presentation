V4VSockets is an efficient, socket-compliant, high performance intra node communication framework.

V4VSockets features:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
\compresslist
\item[$\Rightarrow$] \emph{optimized data path} (data are copied from~/~to the VM kernel memory without the need to share pages between VMs)

\item[$\Rightarrow$] \emph{low-overhead} framework (no intermediary VM --
driver domain -- no scheduling implications are involved) 

\item[$\Rightarrow$] \emph{secure} (no security implications -- data cross the hypervisor and either get dropped or pushed forward using V4V semantics)
\item[$\Rightarrow$] \emph{ultra low latency} and \emph{high bandwidth}
\item[$\Rightarrow$] Open-source, available @ \texttt{https://github.com/HPSI/v4v}

\item[$\Rightarrow$] improves latency for small messages by 81\%

\item[$\Rightarrow$] scales efficiently with the number of VMs, both in terms of latency and bandwidth
\item[$\Rightarrow$] achieves aggregate throughput $\approx$ 17 GB/s for 512 KB messages when 16 VMs exchange data in pairs

We run the matrix-matrix product benchmark: (a) natively via GPU passthrough, (b) via rCUDA over TCP/IP sockets and (c) via rCUDA over V4VSockets. Steps include: (i) 2x input matrix copies, (ii) GPU product compute, (iii) 1x output matrix copy back. V4VSockets:

%\item[$\Rightarrow$] steps: 2x matrix copy, GPU compute, 1x copy back.
\item[$\Rightarrow$] adds a minimum overhead of 15\% (compared to native execution)
\item[$\Rightarrow$] boosts transfer throughput by 7x (at best) compared to TCP/IP
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.5em}

%We observe that the peak throughput is 3.79 GB/s in our baseline experiment,
%while the respective throughput in the remote V4VSockets case is 2.46 GB/s.
%However, for a matrix size of 34 MB (2112 x 4224 float type elements)
%V4VSockets outperforms the generic case by a factor of 7 (0.35 GB/s).
